/* Planning of the Game in JS (Different} Elements, their properties and the actions they will make)
Game ovweview: A street dog üê∂ needs to avoid obstacles that are spawing while he runs trough the city.
The dog will also find randomly food rewards ü•©üçóüçñ that can help him to stay healthy and get some "inmuinity" while he sort out the obstacles.
In some of this obstacles there are also food rewards.

ACTIONS - Game Loop
a. Dog movement, always in X coordinate (horizontal, right) (Example: T-Rex Chrome Dino Game)
b. Obstacles üíÄ move the opossite way (X, horizontal, left), at a different speed and at different levels in Y coordinate

1. For the Dog üê∂
   - Position Coordinatess x, y, h (height), w (width), speed (SpeedGravity, and speedJump)
   - Action: Jump
   - Gravity
   
2. For the Obstacles üíÄ 
   -  Position Coordinatess x, y, h (height), w (width), speed.
   - Action (Automatic movement ‚Üê )

3. Spawn the Obstacles and unSpawn the Obstacles   
   
4. Collision between Dog and Obstacles   

5. Game Over (Specialized Function, because maybe the "game over" can be trigger by other facts beside the collision with the obstacles)

BONUS
6. Life counter
7. Reward / Inmunity - Recover system
